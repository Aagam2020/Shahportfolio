# Depression in the U.S. : A Silent Crisis Among Students

## **Introduction**
My project aims to analyze the prevalence of major depressive episodes among U.S. young adults, with a specific focus on students. I have identified trends and disparities in mental health based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. By focusing on actionable solutions tailored to students, it provides a roadmap for addressing mental health challenges at their roots.

## **Audience**
After discussions with the professor and feedback from other students during the in-class critique, I shifted the audience focus exclusively to students. This adjustment was made to target a specific demographic most affected by depression (ages 18–25) and to create solutions relevant to their needs. My project now addresses:
1. **Students**: Young adults navigating challenges such as academic stress, social pressures, and financial instability.
2. **Student Leaders**: Those advocating for mental health awareness on campuses.
3. **Educational Institutions**: Colleges and universities striving to provide better mental health support.

The relevance lies in equipping students with tools and resources to tackle depression while encouraging institutions to implement student-specific mental health programs.

## Why It Matters
This project is deeply personal to me because I see these struggles in myself and my peers. I want this story to inspire conversations about mental health, reduce stigma, and show students that help is available. Together, we can make mental health a priority and create environments where we can thrive, emotionally and academically.

## **Adjustments Based on Feedback**
Based on feedback from the professor, peers, and the interviews I took, the following changes were made:
1. **Audience Narrowing**:
   The focus shifted exclusively to students, which required refining the narrative to address this demographic more effectively.
   Recommendations now prioritize on-campus solutions and digital mental health platforms tailored to students.

2. **Narrative Refinement**:
   I updated the introduction to highlight challenges students face, such as academic stress and social pressures.
   The narrative structure was reworked to start with compelling insights about the 18–25 age group to immediately capture the attention of the student audience.

3. **Visualization Enhancements**:
   Simplified data visualizations to make them more engaging and accessible to students.
   Added annotations and callouts in the visualizations to directly tie insights to actionable recommendations.

4. **Engagement Improvements**:
   Text-heavy sections were broken down into bullet points or concise paragraphs for easier readability.
   Interactive elements (e.g., tooltips, filters) were incorporated to enhance engagement with data visualizations.

I implemented these changes to ensure the final deliverable resonates deeply with the student audience, providing actionable, relatable, and impactful content.
