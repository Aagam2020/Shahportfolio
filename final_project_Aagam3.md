# Depression in the U.S. : A Silent Crisis Among Students

## **Introduction**
My project aims to analyze the prevalence of major depressive episodes among U.S. young adults, with a specific focus on students. I have identified trends and disparities in mental health based on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. By focusing on actionable solutions tailored to students, it provides a roadmap for addressing mental health challenges at their roots.

## **Audience**
After discussions with the professor and feedback from other students during the in-class critique, I shifted the audience focus exclusively to students. This adjustment was made to target a specific demographic most affected by depression (ages 18–25) and to create solutions relevant to their needs. My project now addresses:
1. **Students**: Young adults navigating challenges such as academic stress, social pressures, and financial instability.
2. **Student Leaders**: Those advocating for mental health awareness on campuses.
3. **Educational Institutions**: Colleges and universities striving to provide better mental health support.

The relevance lies in equipping students with tools and resources to tackle depression while encouraging institutions to implement student-specific mental health programs.

## Why It Matters
This project is deeply personal to me because I see these struggles in myself and my peers. I want this story to inspire conversations about mental health, reduce stigma, and show students that help is available. Together, we can make mental health a priority and create environments where we can thrive, emotionally and academically.

## **Adjustments Based on Feedback**
Based on feedback from the professor, peers, and the interviews I took, the following changes were made:
1. **Audience Narrowing**:
   The focus shifted exclusively to students, which required refining the narrative to address this demographic more effectively.
   Recommendations now prioritize on-campus solutions and digital mental health platforms tailored to students.

2. **Narrative Refinement**:
   I updated the introduction to highlight challenges students face, such as academic stress and social pressures.
   The narrative structure was reworked to start with compelling insights about the 18–25 age group to immediately capture the attention of the student audience.

3. **Visualization Enhancements**:
   Simplified data visualizations to make them more engaging and accessible to students.
   Added annotations and callouts in the visualizations to directly tie insights to actionable recommendations.

4. **Engagement Improvements**:
   Text-heavy sections were broken down into bullet points or concise paragraphs for easier readability.
   Interactive elements (e.g., tooltips, filters) were incorporated to enhance engagement with data visualizations.

I implemented these changes to ensure the final deliverable resonates deeply with the student audience, providing actionable, relatable, and impactful content.

### Design Decisions

1. **Target Audience Shift**:
   Initially, the project aimed to address multiple demographics, but after discussions with the professor and feedback from students during the In class critique and my interviewees, I narrowed the focus to students aged 18–25. This allowed the narrative to become more relatable and impactful for the intended audience.

2. **Data Visualization Refinement**:
   **Bar Chart**: 
     Provides a clear comparison of depression rates by age, race, and sex. It visually emphasizes the disparities, such as the significant impact on females and 
     the higher prevalence among individuals identifying as AI/AN and multiracial.
   **Pie Chart**:
     Simplifies the distribution of depression percentages across age groups, making it easy to see the disproportionate burden on young adults.
   **Line Chart**:
     Demonstrates the increase in depression rates for the 18–25 age group over time, highlighting a 67% rise between 2015 and 2020.

3. **Simplified Visuals**:
   Based on feedback, I improved readability by using consistent colors, larger fonts, and simplified legends. These changes make the visualizations more accessible while ensuring key messages are not lost.

This project has been a journey of iterative improvement, shaped by feedback and guided by the goal of creating a relatable, student-centered narrative.

Through this project, I’ve learned the value of understanding the audience, incorporating feedback, and refining visuals to create a cohesive, impactful story.
