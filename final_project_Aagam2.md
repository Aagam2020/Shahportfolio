# Introduction

Depression has become one of the most pressing public health challenges in the United States, affecting millions of lives and disrupting communities. In 2021, nearly 18.6% of young adults aged 18–25 experienced major depressive episodes, a stark contrast to the 4.5% rate among older adults aged 50 and above. This alarming disparity highlights the urgent need to understand and address the unique factors contributing to depression in specific demographic groups. By analyzing depression prevalence across age, gender, and racial/ethnic lines, we can uncover key trends and pave the way for actionable solutions.

## Rising Insights

The data reveals significant disparities in how depression affects different groups. These insights are crucial for understanding the scope of the issue:

Age-Based Trends: Young adults aged 18–25 reported the highest prevalence of major depressive episodes at 18.6%.In contrast, older adults aged 50 and above had a prevalence rate of only 4.5%.This stark difference underscores the vulnerability of younger populations, often linked to life transitions, financial instability, and social media influences.

Gender Disparities: Women are disproportionately affected by depression, with a prevalence rate of 10.3% compared to 6.2% in men. Societal pressures, gender roles, and access to care contribute significantly to this disparity.

Racial/Ethnic Disparities: Individuals identifying as American Indian/Alaskan Native (11.2%) and those of two or more racial/ethnic backgrounds (13.9%) experienced higher rates of depression compared to other groups. Systemic barriers to mental health care, cultural stigmas, and economic challenges are key factors driving these disparities.

Each of these trends is visualized in detail to provide a clearer picture of who is most affected by depression and why. For example, the bar chart below illustrates how the 18–25 age group accounts for 25% of all individuals experiencing major depressive episodes in 2021.

## Actionable Recommendations

Addressing these disparities requires targeted interventions tailored to the needs of specific groups. Based on the data, here are actionable recommendations:

Youth-Focused Mental Health Programs: Establish on-campus counseling services, peer support networks, and digital mental health platforms to address the unique challenges faced by young adults.

Gender-Sensitive Interventions: Develop outreach programs and therapy initiatives that focus on the specific stressors affecting women, including workplace stress, family responsibilities, and societal expectations.

Culturally Competent Care: Increase funding for mental health services in underserved communities, particularly those serving American Indian/Alaskan Native populations and individuals with mixed racial/ethnic identities. Train mental health professionals to provide culturally sensitive care to reduce barriers and stigmas.

Public Awareness Campaigns: Promote mental health education to reduce stigma, encourage early intervention, and raise awareness about available resources.

By focusing on these solutions, we can take meaningful steps toward reducing the burden of depression and ensuring that everyone has access to the care they need.

The above graph highlights the rising prevalence of depression among young adults aged 18–25 from 2015 to 2020. Starting at 10.3% in 2015, the rate steadily climbed to 17.2% by 2020, reflecting a 67% increase over the five years. This trend indicates a growing mental health crisis within this demographic, necessitating urgent attention and intervention.

## Insights

Significant Increase Over Time: Depression rates among young adults have increased sharply, with the steepest rise observed between 2018 and 2020. The data reveals a sustained upward trajectory, suggesting systemic issues exacerbating mental health struggles in this age group.

Vulnerability of Young Adults: The 18–25 age range often involves significant life changes, such as starting higher education, entering the workforce, and managing personal relationships. These challenges may heighten stress and anxiety, contributing to the increase in depression rates.

Influence of Social and Economic Pressures: Factors like social media pressures, comparison culture, and economic challenges, including student debt and job insecurity, play a pivotal role in the mental health struggles of this demographic.

Potential Impact of COVID-19:Although the data stops at 2020, the pandemic likely exacerbated existing challenges for young adults, including isolation, financial stress, and disruption of life plans.

These findings align with research published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), which reported increases in depression among young adults from 10.3% (2015) to 17.2% (2020). For further details, you can refer to the NCBI report on depression trends.

## Recommendations

Expand Youth-Focused Mental Health Programs: On-Campus Support: Colleges and universities should enhance counseling services and provide mental health resources tailored to the needs of young adults. 

**Early-Career Interventions**: Employers hiring recent graduates should implement wellness programs addressing the specific challenges of early-career employees.

**Address Digital and Social Media Pressures**: Promote awareness campaigns about the impact of excessive social media use on mental health. Encourage digital well-being initiatives, such as setting screen time limits and fostering positive online communities.

**Increase Access to Affordable Mental Health Services**: Expand affordable therapy and counseling options for young adults, particularly for those in underserved communities. Increase federal and state funding for mental health programs targeting youth.

**Launch Public Awareness Campaigns**: Develop campaigns to destigmatize mental health struggles and encourage early intervention. Highlight success stories of individuals overcoming mental health challenges to inspire hope and action.

**Strengthen Crisis Intervention Services**: Expand the reach of 24/7 crisis hotlines and online support platforms tailored to young adults. Provide accessible and confidential support for those at risk.

**Support Parents, Educators, and Mentors**: Train parents, educators, and mentors to recognize the signs of depression and provide appropriate guidance. Foster open conversations about mental health in families and schools.

# User Research and Feedback

User feedback summarizes the process and findings from user interviews conducted as part of the project. The goal of these interviews was to evaluate the clarity, engagement, and overall effectiveness of the project's narrative and visualizations.

## User Research Protocol

My project aims to communicate insights about depression prevalence in the United States, targeting four primary audiences: **policymakers**, **mental health advocates**, **researchers and analysts**, and the **general public**. These groups were chosen based on their potential to act on the insights provided or their interest in understanding the disparities in mental health.

To ensure diverse perspectives, I interviewed four individuals representing these audiences. They included a psychology graduate student (mid-20s), a data analyst (late-20s), a social worker (mid-40s), and a retired teacher (mid-50s). This group provided a broad range of feedback, from technical critiques to content engagement insights.

The interviews were structured around the following script:
1. Regarding the narrative: Does the overall story make sense to you? Is it easy to follow? What part of the story did you find most compelling?
2. Regarding the visualizations: Are the visualizations clear and informative? What aspects of the visuals did you not like or find confusing?
3. Regarding engagement: Did the story hold your attention? What could make it more engaging for you?
4. Regarding actionable insights: Does the data provide clear takeaways? Is there anything missing that you’d like to see?

Participants reviewed the project's wireframes, storyboards, and initial data visualizations during the interviews. I documented their feedback for analysis.

## Key Findings

The feedback revealed several consistent themes across participants. The age-based pie chart was universally appreciated for its clarity and depth of information, though it was suggested that adding interactive elements like tooltips or filters could make it more engaging and easier to explore. Another common suggestion was to simplify overly detailed visuals to avoid overwhelming the audience.

Text content emerged as another area for improvement. Some sections felt too dense, with participants recommending shorter paragraphs or bullet points to improve readability. Additionally, participants emphasized the importance of linking recommendations directly to the data to enhance clarity and persuasiveness.

In terms of engagement, all participants found the narrative structure logical and compelling. However, there was a strong consensus that interactive elements and visual breaks could improve the overall experience.

While most observations were consistent, there were some conflicting opinions. For example, the data analyst preferred a minimalist design style with fewer colors, while the social worker preferred bold, vivid colors to highlight disparities. Similarly, opinions on story structure varied. The student suggested beginning with the most striking insight—the high prevalence of depression among 18–25-year-olds—while the retired teacher advocated starting with a broader overview of depression trends before delving into specifics.

## Key Quotes from Interviews

One participant, the psychology student, remarked, "Adding interactivity, like tooltips, would make this chart easier to explore and much more engaging." A retired teacher noted, "Start with an overview of depression trends, then move into the demographic disparities to set the stage better." The social worker commented, "The charts are impactful, but some of them feel a bit too busy. Simplifying them slightly could make the message clearer."

---

## Planned Design Changes

Based on this feedback, several updates are planned to improve the project's effectiveness and user experience.

The visualizations will be enhanced by adding interactive features such as hover-over tooltips and filters to the age-based pie chart which I would now visualize on Tableau instead of pen-paper. A consistent and balanced color palette will be applied to ensure the visuals are both impactful and accessible.

The narrative will be revised to start with the most compelling insight—the high prevalence of depression among the 18–25 age group. Text-heavy sections will be broken into smaller paragraphs or concise points to improve readability and flow.

Recommendations will be directly tied to specific data points by adding annotations to the visualizations. For example, actionable solutions for young adults will be linked explicitly to the age-based prevalence chart. Additionally, a timeline visualization will be added to provide historical context for the trends in depression rates.
