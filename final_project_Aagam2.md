## Narrowing Down to Depression by Age Groups

Depression, though widespread across demographics, disproportionately impacts certain age groups, particularly young adults aged 18–25. This focus on age is critical because it is during these formative years that individuals face unique challenges: transitioning into adulthood, pursuing higher education, beginning careers, and navigating complex social dynamics. The data shows that addressing depression early within this age group can lead to significant long-term benefits, irrespective of gender, race, or ethnicity.

## Key Insights on Age-Specific Focus

**Why Age Matters**: Young adulthood is a time of immense psychological vulnerability, with external pressures like social media, career uncertainty, and financial instability compounding the risk of mental health challenges. Depression left untreated during this stage can evolve into chronic mental health conditions, affecting long-term well-being, productivity, and quality of life.

**Early Intervention and Its Impact**: Research and case studies highlight that early diagnosis and treatment of depression yield significantly better outcomes. When treated early, the recovery rate is higher, and the risk of relapse diminishes. The focus on treating depression at a young age ensures that individuals have the tools to manage stressors and build resilience, regardless of future challenges.

I related to the age group of 18-25 year olds so that is why I decided to narrow it down to that particular age group.


# User Research and Feedback

---

## User Research Protocol

My project aims to communicate insights about depression prevalence in the United States, targeting four primary audiences: **policymakers**, **mental health advocates**, **researchers and analysts**, and the **general public**. These groups were chosen based on their potential to act on the insights provided or their interest in understanding the disparities in mental health.

To ensure diverse perspectives, I interviewed four individuals representing these audiences. They included a psychology graduate student (mid-20s), a data analyst (late-20s), a social worker (mid-40s), and a retired teacher (mid-50s). This group provided a broad range of feedback, from technical critiques to content engagement insights.

The interviews were structured around the following script:
1. **Regarding the narrative**: Does the overall story make sense to you? Is it easy to follow? What part of the story did you find most compelling?
2. **Regarding the visualizations**: Are the visualizations clear and informative? What aspects of the visuals did you not like or find confusing?
3. **Regarding engagement**: Did the story hold your attention? What could make it more engaging for you?
4. **Regarding actionable insights**: Does the data provide clear takeaways? Is there anything missing that you’d like to see?

Participants reviewed the project's wireframes, storyboards, and initial data visualizations during the interviews. I documented their feedback for analysis.

## Key Findings

The feedback revealed several consistent themes across participants. The **age-based pie chart** was appreciated for its clarity and the information it gave, though it was suggested that adding interactive elements like tooltips or filters could make it more engaging and easier to explore. Another common suggestion was to simplify overly detailed visuals to avoid overwhelming the audience.

**Text content** emerged as another area for improvement. Some sections felt too dense, with participants recommending shorter paragraphs or bullet points to improve readability. 

In terms of engagement, all participants found the narrative structure logical and compelling. However, there was a strong consensus that interactive elements and visual breaks could improve the overall experience.

While most observations were consistent, there were some conflicting opinions. For example, the data analyst preferred a minimalist design style with fewer colors, while the social worker preferred bold, vivid colors to highlight disparities. Similarly, opinions on story structure varied. The student suggested beginning with the most striking insight—the high prevalence of depression among 18–25-year-olds—while the retired teacher advocated starting with a broader overview of depression trends before delving into specifics.

## Key Quotes from Interviews

One participant, the psychology student, remarked, "Adding interactivity, like tooltips, would make this chart easier to explore and much more engaging." The retired teacher noted, "Start with an overview of depression trends, then move into the demographic disparities to set the stage better." The social worker commented, "The charts are impactful, and give well documented information which is helpful in understanding the story."

## Planned Design Changes

Based on this feedback, several updates are planned to improve the project's effectiveness and user experience.

The visualizations will be enhanced by adding interactive features such as hover-over tooltips and filters to the age-based pie chart which I would now visualize on Tableau instead of pen-paper. (I have already added the pie chart on Shorthand). 

The narrative will be revised to start with the most compelling insight—the high prevalence of depression among the 18–25 age group. Text-heavy sections will be broken into smaller paragraphs or concise points to improve readability and flow.

Recommendations will be directly tied to specific data points by adding annotations to the visualizations. For example, actionable solutions for young adults will be linked explicitly to the age-based prevalence chart. Additionally, a timeline visualization will be added to provide historical context for the trends in depression rates. (I have already added that on Shorthand).
