#### **Visualization Clarity**
1. Are the visualizations clear and informative?
2. What do you like/dislike about the visualizations?

#### **User Engagement**
1. Does the story keep your attention? Would you want to explore further?
2. What changes would make it more engaging for you?

#### **Actionable Insights**
1. Does the data provide actionable insights?
2. What additional information would you like to see?

## **Key Findings**

### **Consistent Feedback**
1. **Visualizations**:
   - The age-based bar chart is highly informative but could benefit from interactivity (e.g., tooltips).
   - Simplification of some visual elements would make the story less overwhelming.

2. **Text Content**:
   - Some sections are text-heavy. Breaking these into shorter paragraphs or bullet points would help.
   - Users suggested aligning recommendations directly with the data insights for better clarity.

3. **Engagement**:
   - All participants appreciated the narrative flow but suggested adding interactive elements for better engagement.

---

### **Conflicting Observations**
1. **Design Preferences**:
   - The young professional preferred minimalist designs with fewer colors.
   - The social worker liked bold, vivid colors to emphasize disparities.

2. **Order of Story**:
   - The student recommended starting with the 18–25 age group data to grab attention.
   - The retired teacher preferred a general introduction to depression before diving into specific insights.

## **Key Quotes**
- **Student, mid-20s**: "Adding interactivity, like tooltips, would make this chart easier to explore."
- **Adult, mid-50s**: "Start with an overview of depression trends, then move into the demographic disparities."
- **Social Worker, mid-40s**: "The charts are impactful, but some of them are a little too busy. Simplify where possible."

---

## **Planned Design Changes**
Based on the feedback, the following changes will be implemented:
1. **Improved Visualizations**:
   - Add interactivity (hover-over tooltips, filters) to the age-based bar chart.
   - Simplify complex charts by grouping similar age ranges or using stacked bars.
   - Use a consistent, balanced color palette.

2. **Refined Narrative**:
   - Start with the most impactful insight (18–25 age group prevalence).
   - Break text-heavy sections into concise bullet points or smaller paragraphs.

3. **Enhanced Recommendations**:
   - Add annotations to visualizations that tie data directly to actionable solutions.

4. **Increased Engagement**:
   - Include a call-to-action section encouraging readers to explore resources or share insights.
   - Add a timeline visualization to provide historical context for depression trends.

This user feedback and the planned changes will guide the next steps in refining the project.
