# User Research and Feedback

User feedback summarizes the process and findings from user interviews conducted as part of the project. The goal of these interviews was to evaluate the clarity, engagement, and overall effectiveness of the project's narrative and visualizations.

## User Research Protocol

My project aims to communicate insights about depression prevalence in the United States, targeting four primary audiences: **policymakers**, **mental health advocates**, **researchers and analysts**, and the **general public**. These groups were chosen based on their potential to act on the insights provided or their interest in understanding the disparities in mental health.

To ensure diverse perspectives, I interviewed four individuals representing these audiences. They included a psychology graduate student (mid-20s), a data analyst (late-20s), a social worker (mid-40s), and a retired teacher (mid-50s). This group provided a broad range of feedback, from technical critiques to content engagement insights.

The interviews were structured around the following script:
1. Regarding the narrative: "Does the overall story make sense to you? Is it easy to follow? What part of the story did you find most compelling?"
2. Regarding the visualizations: "Are the visualizations clear and informative? What aspects of the visuals did you not like or find confusing?"
3. Regarding engagement: "Did the story hold your attention? What could make it more engaging for you?"
4. Regarding actionable insights: "Does the data provide clear takeaways? Is there anything missing that you’d like to see?"

Participants reviewed the project's wireframes, storyboards, and initial data visualizations during the interviews. I documented their feedback for analysis.

## Key Findings

The feedback revealed several consistent themes across participants. The age-based pie chart was universally appreciated for its clarity and depth of information, though it was suggested that adding interactive elements like tooltips or filters could make it more engaging and easier to explore. Another common suggestion was to simplify overly detailed visuals to avoid overwhelming the audience.

Text content emerged as another area for improvement. Some sections felt too dense, with participants recommending shorter paragraphs or bullet points to improve readability. Additionally, participants emphasized the importance of linking recommendations directly to the data to enhance clarity and persuasiveness.

In terms of engagement, all participants found the narrative structure logical and compelling. However, there was a strong consensus that interactive elements and visual breaks could improve the overall experience.

While most observations were consistent, there were some conflicting opinions. For example, the data analyst preferred a minimalist design style with fewer colors, while the social worker preferred bold, vivid colors to highlight disparities. Similarly, opinions on story structure varied. The student suggested beginning with the most striking insight—the high prevalence of depression among 18–25-year-olds—while the retired teacher advocated starting with a broader overview of depression trends before delving into specifics.

## Key Quotes from Interviews

One participant, the psychology student, remarked, "Adding interactivity, like tooltips, would make this chart easier to explore and much more engaging." A retired teacher noted, "Start with an overview of depression trends, then move into the demographic disparities to set the stage better." The social worker commented, "The charts are impactful, but some of them feel a bit too busy. Simplifying them slightly could make the message clearer."

## Planned Design Changes

Based on this feedback, several updates are planned to improve the project's effectiveness and user experience.

The visualizations will be enhanced by adding interactive features such as hover-over tooltips and filters to the age-based pie chart which I would now visualize on Tableau instead of pen-paper. A consistent and balanced color palette will be applied to ensure the visuals are both impactful and accessible.

The narrative will be revised to start with the most compelling insight—the high prevalence of depression among the 18–25 age group. Text-heavy sections will be broken into smaller paragraphs or concise points to improve readability and flow.

Recommendations will be directly tied to specific data points by adding annotations to the visualizations. For example, actionable solutions for young adults will be linked explicitly to the age-based prevalence chart. Additionally, a timeline visualization will be added to provide historical context for the trends in depression rates.
