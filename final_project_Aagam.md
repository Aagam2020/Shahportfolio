# Final Project: Adult Depression Analysis (2012–2018)

## High-Level Summary

This project analyzes trends in adult depression from 2012 to 2018, focusing on demographic factors such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex. The aim is to uncover disparities in depression rates across different population groups and identify patterns that can inform interventions and policy decisions.

By exploring data segmented by these demographic factors, the project seeks to answer critical questions, such as: Which age groups and income levels report the highest rates of depression? Are there significant differences in depression rates between racial or ethnic groups? How do education and sex influence depression prevalence? Through data visualization and storytelling, this project will present a clear narrative to policymakers, mental health professionals, and advocates. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to improve mental health resources and reduce disparities in care.

## Project Structure

The project structure I am following is a Narrative-driven project structure.
### **Introduction (Setting the Stage)**

The introduction will provide an overview of adult depression as a growing public health issue from 2012 to 2018. It will highlight the societal and economic impacts of untreated depression and present the dataset, emphasizing its coverage of demographics such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex. The section will set the stage for the analysis, showing why understanding these disparities is critical. The introduction will conclude with a one-sentence summary: *"Understanding how depression affects different demographics over time can guide targeted interventions and improve mental health outcomes."*

### **Rising Insights (Exploring the Data)**

This section will analyze trends in depression rates over the years 2012 to 2018. It will explore key demographic breakdowns, including age groups, income levels, education levels, race-ethnicities, and sex. The analysis will focus on identifying which age groups experience the highest and lowest rates of depression, how economic disparities correlate with depression prevalence, and how education and sex influence depression rates. Visualizations will include line charts for depression rates over time by age group, bar charts for depression prevalence by income or education, and heatmaps to show regional differences in depression across race-ethnicities.

### **Climactic Reveal (Key Findings)**

The climactic reveal will present the most impactful insights, such as identifying the demographic groups most affected by depression. It will highlight disparities and discuss possible causes, including economic inequities and access to mental health services. The findings may include trends like *"Depression rates were highest among individuals with low income and those identifying as [specific racial-ethnic group]."* This section will also uncover unexpected trends, such as improvements or worsening disparities over time, and provide data-driven insights to emphasize key discoveries.

### **Resolution (Actionable Takeaways)**

The resolution will summarize the key takeaways, including which demographics require targeted mental health resources and policy recommendations to address the identified disparities. It will conclude with a call to action for policymakers to invest in mental health programs targeting the most affected groups and for mental health professionals to develop tailored interventions for high-risk populations. The section will close by emphasizing the importance of addressing these disparities to improve mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of depression.

## The Data

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project is titled *"Adult Depression LGHC Indicator 24"* and has been uploaded to the GitHub repository for this project. This dataset spans the years 2012 to 2018 and includes information about depression rates segmented by various demographic factors such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex. The dataset provides key fields such as "Strata," "Strata Name," and "Frequency," which are used to categorize and quantify depression rates across these demographics.

This data is valuable for identifying patterns and disparities in depression rates and for developing actionable insights for policymakers and mental health advocates.

### Data Usage
This dataset will be used to:
1. Analyze trends in depression rates over the years 2012 to 2018.
2. Compare depression rates across demographic groups (age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex).
3. Identify disparities in depression rates and correlations between demographics and mental health outcomes.
4. Create visualizations such as faceted bar charts to present trends and insights clearly.

The analysis will address critical questions, including:
- Which demographic groups are most affected by depression?
- How do depression rates vary over time and across categories?
- Are there trends that highlight the need for targeted mental health interventions?

### Data Access
The dataset is publicly accessible and has been uploaded to the repository. You can access the dataset directly at the following link:

## Method and Medium

To complete my final project, I will use Tableau for creating interactive data visualizations and Shorthand for presenting the findings in an engaging, narrative-driven format.

Tableau will be used to design and develop interactive visualizations such as faceted bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps. These visualizations will help showcase trends in depression rates across demographics (age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex) from 2012 to 2018. Tableau's interactivity will allow users to explore the data themselves, offering insights in a visually compelling way.

Shorthand will serve as the platform for integrating the Tableau visualizations into a cohesive digital narrative. It will enable the inclusion of textual explanations, annotated visualizations, and a logical flow to guide the audience through the project's findings. This platform ensures the project is accessible, visually appealing, and engaging for my target audience, including policymakers, mental health advocates, and researchers.

The final deliverable will be an interactive, stand-alone web-based story hosted online. It will combine data visualizations created in Tableau with a storytelling format built in Shorthand. The project will include explanations and insights that provide actionable recommendations based on the data. This approach ensures the project is both visually impactful and easy to navigate, offering an immersive experience for the audience.
