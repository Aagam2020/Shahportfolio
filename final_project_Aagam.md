# Final Project: Adult Depression Analysis (2012–2018)

## High-Level Summary

This project analyzes trends in adult depression from 2012 to 2018, focusing on demographic factors such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex. The aim is to uncover disparities in depression rates across different population groups and identify patterns that can inform interventions and policy decisions.

By exploring data segmented by these demographic factors, the project seeks to answer critical questions, such as:
- Which age groups and income levels report the highest rates of depression?
- Are there significant differences in depression rates between racial or ethnic groups?
- How do education and sex influence depression prevalence?

Through data visualization and storytelling, this project will present a clear narrative to policymakers, mental health professionals, and advocates. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to improve mental health resources and reduce disparities in care.

## Project Structure

### **Introduction (Setting the Stage)**
- Provide an overview of adult depression as a growing public health issue from 2012 to 2018.
- Highlight the societal and economic impacts of untreated depression.
- Present the dataset, emphasizing its coverage of demographics such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex.
- **One-Sentence Summary**: *"Understanding how depression affects different demographics over time can guide targeted interventions and improve mental health outcomes."*

### **Rising Insights (Exploring the Data)**
- Analyze trends in depression rates over the years (2012–2018).
- Present key demographic breakdowns:
  - **Age Groups**: Highlight which age groups experience the highest and lowest rates.
  - **Income Levels**: Show how economic disparities correlate with depression prevalence.
  - **Education Levels**: Explore differences in depression rates based on educational attainment.
  - **Race-Ethnicities**: Identify disparities among racial and ethnic groups.
  - **Sex**: Compare depression rates between males and females.
- Example Visualizations:
  - **Line Chart**: Depression rates over time by age group.
  - **Bar Chart**: Depression prevalence by income or education.
  - **Heatmap**: Regional differences in depression across race-ethnicities.

### **Climactic Reveal (Key Findings)**
- Present the most impactful insights:
  - Identify the demographic group(s) most affected by depression.
  - Highlight disparities and discuss possible causes (e.g., economic inequities, access to mental health services).
  - Example Finding: *"Depression rates were highest among individuals with low income and those identifying as [specific racial-ethnic group]."*
- Use data to reveal unexpected trends, such as improvements or worsening disparities over time.

### **Resolution (Actionable Takeaways)**
- Summarize key takeaways:
  - Demographics that require targeted mental health resources.
  - Policy recommendations to address identified disparities.
- Conclude with a call to action:
  - For policymakers: Invest in mental health programs targeting the most affected groups.
  - For mental health professionals: Develop tailored interventions for high-risk populations.
