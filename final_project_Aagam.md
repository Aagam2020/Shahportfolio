# Final Project: Depression Prevalence Among U.S. Adults (2021)

## High-Level Summary

This project analyzes the prevalence of major depressive episodes among U.S. adults in 2021, focusing on key demographic factors such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Leveraging the data visualization provided by SAMHSA, the analysis seeks to uncover significant disparities and trends in depression rates across these population groups. The central aim is to answer pivotal questions: Why does the age group of 18-25 report the highest prevalence of depression compared to other age groups? How do sex and racial/ethnic backgrounds influence depression rates? By providing a clear, data-backed narrative, this project aims to empower policymakers, mental health professionals, and advocates with actionable insights to guide interventions and reduce disparities in mental health care access.

## Introduction (Setting the Stage)

The introduction highlights the growing concern over depression as a public health crisis in 2021, with a focus on how it impacts different demographic groups. The societal and economic costs of untreated depression are immense, ranging from lost productivity to strain on healthcare systems. The SAMHSA dataset reveals striking trends in depression prevalence across sex, age, and race/ethnicity.

One critical finding from the dataset is that young adults aged 18-25 experienced the highest rates of depression at 18.6%, compared to just 4.5% among those aged 50 and older. Additionally, females (10.3%) reported significantly higher depression rates compared to males (6.2%). Among racial/ethnic groups, individuals identifying as AI/AN (11.2%) and those with two or more racial/ethnic backgrounds (13.9%) also exhibited elevated rates of depression.

## Rising Insights (Exploring the Data)

The analysis delves deeper into the demographic trends revealed in the visualization. Depression rates are highest among individuals aged 18-25 (18.6%), indicating that young adulthood is a particularly vulnerable life stage. Conversely, the prevalence drops significantly for adults aged 50+ (4.5%), suggesting resilience or other protective factors in older age.

Females consistently report higher rates of depression (10.3%) compared to males (6.2%). This may stem from biological, psychological, or societal influences, such as greater societal pressure or underreporting by males.

Racial and ethnic disparities are also apparent, with individuals identifying as AI/AN (11.2%) and those of two or more racial/ethnic backgrounds (13.9%) facing disproportionately high rates of depression. These findings point to systemic inequities in access to mental health care and broader social determinants of health.

## Climactic Reveal (Key Findings)

The most critical finding is the overwhelming prevalence of depression among individuals aged 18-25. This age group faces unique challenges, including navigating major life transitions, economic uncertainty, and the impact of social media on mental well-being. The disparity compared to other age groups is striking, with rates more than four times higher than those aged 50+.

Other key findings include the pronounced gender gap, with females reporting significantly higher rates, and the elevated prevalence among AI/AN individuals and those of mixed racial/ethnic backgrounds, highlighting the intersectionality of race, mental health, and systemic barriers to care.

These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted mental health programs for young adults, especially those from marginalized racial/ethnic backgrounds. Without intervention, the long-term societal costs of untreated depression among these groups will only escalate.

## Resolution (Actionable Takeaways)

The analysis concludes with a call to action for stakeholders to address the identified disparities. Recommendations include developing youth-centric mental health resources such as campus counseling programs, online therapy platforms, and peer support groups. Gender-sensitive approaches should address unique stressors faced by females through community outreach and specialized therapy options. Equity in care must be prioritized through increased funding for culturally competent mental health programs in underserved communities, particularly for AI/AN and mixed-race populations. Public awareness campaigns should also promote understanding of depressionâ€™s signs and symptoms to reduce stigma and encourage early intervention.


## The Data

### Data Source

The dataset used for this project comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), focusing on the prevalence of major depressive episodes among U.S. adults in 2021. This dataset provides critical insights segmented by key demographic factors, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The visualized data, as seen in the provided graph, highlights disparities in depression rates across these groups, offering a comprehensive view of the mental health landscape in the U.S.

### Data Usage

The SAMHSA dataset underpins the analysis and helps answer key questions about depression prevalence. It will be used to:
- Analyze depression rates across demographic groups, with a specific focus on age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
- Identify populations most affected by major depressive episodes, such as young adults aged 18-25, who exhibit the highest prevalence at 18.6%.
- Explore patterns that emphasize the need for targeted interventions and improved access to mental health resources.

This dataset will drive the visualizations and storytelling in the project, such as bar charts that clearly show disparities across demographics. By breaking down the data, the analysis will provide a better understanding of which groups face the greatest challenges and why these disparities exist.

### Key Insights from the Data

The most notable insights from the dataset include:
- The **18-25 age group** experiences the highest depression prevalence at 18.6%, compared to just 4.5% for adults aged 50 and older.
- Females report higher rates of depression (10.3%) compared to males (6.2%), highlighting significant gender differences.
- Among racial/ethnic groups, individuals identifying as AI/AN (11.2%) and those with two or more racial/ethnic identities (13.9%) face disproportionately high rates of depression.

These findings are critical for understanding the disparities in mental health outcomes and informing strategies to address them.

### Data Access

The SAMHSA dataset is publicly available and serves as the foundation for this analysis. 

## Method and Medium

To complete my final project, I will use Tableau for creating interactive data visualizations and Shorthand for presenting the findings in an engaging, narrative-driven format.

Tableau will be used to design and develop interactive visualizations such as faceted bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps. These visualizations will help showcase trends in depression rates across demographics (age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex) from 2012 to 2018. Tableau's interactivity will allow users to explore the data themselves, offering insights in a visually compelling way.

Shorthand will serve as the platform for integrating the Tableau visualizations into a cohesive digital narrative. It will enable the inclusion of textual explanations, annotated visualizations, and a logical flow to guide the audience through the project's findings. This platform ensures the project is accessible, visually appealing, and engaging for my target audience, including policymakers, mental health advocates, and researchers.

The final deliverable will be an interactive, stand-alone web-based story hosted online. It will combine data visualizations created in Tableau with a storytelling format built in Shorthand. The project will include explanations and insights that provide actionable recommendations based on the data. This approach ensures the project is both visually impactful and easy to navigate, offering an immersive experience for the audience.
