# Final Project: Depression Prevalence Among U.S. Adults (2021)

## High-Level Summary

This project analyzes the prevalence of major depressive episodes among U.S. adults in 2021, focusing on key demographic factors such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Leveraging the data visualization provided by SAMHSA, the analysis seeks to uncover significant disparities and trends in depression rates across these population groups. The central aim is to answer pivotal questions: Why does the age group of 18-25 report the highest prevalence of depression compared to other age groups? How do sex and racial/ethnic backgrounds influence depression rates? By providing a clear, data-backed narrative, this project aims to empower policymakers, mental health professionals, and advocates with actionable insights to guide interventions and reduce disparities in mental health care access.

## Project Strucutre

The project structure I am following is a Narrative-Driven project structure.
## **Setup (Introduction)**

Depression is a growing public health crisis, with its impact spanning social, economic, and healthcare systems. In 2021, data from SAMHSA revealed significant disparities in depression rates across demographics, underscoring an urgent need to address this issue.

A critical observation is that young adults aged 18-25 experienced the highest prevalence of depression, at **18.6%**. This stands in stark contrast to older adults aged 50+, who showed a rate of just **4.5%**. Additionally:
- **Females (10.3%)** were more affected than males (**6.2%**).
- Racial and ethnic disparities emerged, with individuals identifying as **AI/AN (11.2%)** and those of two or more racial/ethnic backgrounds (**13.9%**) experiencing elevated rates.

---

## **Conflict (Rising Insights)**

The data highlights alarming inequalities in depression prevalence that disrupts the perception of mental health being universally manageable. The **18-25 age group** emerges as the most vulnerable, facing depression rates more than four times higher than older adults aged 50+. This can be attributed to:
- **Life transitions,** such as education, employment, and relationships.
- **Financial instability** and societal pressures, exacerbated by the influence of social media.

Similarly, gender differences point to a systemic problem where societal pressures disproportionately burden **females**, leading to consistently higher depression rates. **Racial disparities** add another layer of complexity, as **AI/AN individuals** and those of mixed racial/ethnic backgrounds face systemic barriers to mental health care.

## **Resolution (Climactic Reveal and Actionable Takeaways)**

To combat these disparities, targeted action is required to address the specific needs of the most affected groups. The following solutions are critical based on my own research:
1. **Young Adults (18-25):**  
   Prioritize youth-specific mental health programs, such as on-campus counseling, peer support networks, and digital mental health platforms.
   
2. **Gender-Sensitive Interventions:**  
   Develop outreach and therapy initiatives tailored to the unique stressors faced by females.

3. **Racial Equity in Care:**  
   Increase funding for culturally competent mental health services in underserved communities, focusing on **AI/AN** and mixed-race populations.

4. **Public Awareness Campaigns:**  
   Promote education on recognizing depressionâ€™s symptoms, reducing stigma, and encouraging early intervention.

## The Data
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d48cfe-75ca-4762-aa7b-920c7ab0ebee)

### Data Source

The dataset used for this project comes from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), focusing on the prevalence of major depressive episodes among U.S. adults in 2021. This dataset provides critical insights segmented by key demographic factors, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The visualized data, as seen in the provided graph, highlights disparities in depression rates across these groups, offering a comprehensive view of the mental health landscape in the U.S.

---

### Data Usage

The SAMHSA dataset underpins the analysis and helps answer key questions about depression prevalence. It will be used to:
- Analyze depression rates across demographic groups, with a specific focus on age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
- Identify populations most affected by major depressive episodes, such as young adults aged 18-25, who exhibit the highest prevalence at 18.6%.
- Explore patterns that emphasize the need for targeted interventions and improved access to mental health resources.

By breaking down the data, the analysis will provide a better understanding of which groups face the greatest challenges and why these disparities exist.

---

### Key Insights from the Data

The most notable insights from the dataset include:
- The **18-25 age group** experiences the highest depression prevalence at 18.6%, compared to just 4.5% for adults aged 50 and older.
- Females report higher rates of depression (10.3%) compared to males (6.2%), highlighting significant gender differences.
- Among racial/ethnic groups, individuals identifying as AI/AN (11.2%) and those with two or more racial/ethnic identities (13.9%) face disproportionately high rates of depression.

### Population Depression categorized by Age group:-  
![Distribution of Major Depression Disorder by Age Group (2021)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aagam2020/Shahportfolio/main/Depression_piechart.jpeg)

The 18-25 age group, despite spanning only seven years, accounts for approximately 25% of all individuals experiencing major depressive disorder in 2021. This stark finding highlights the disproportionate burden of depression among young adults compared to other age groups.

These findings are critical for understanding the disparities in mental health outcomes and informing strategies to address them.

### Data Access

The SAMHSA dataset is publicly available and serves as the foundation for this analysis.

## Method and Medium

To complete my final project, I will use Tableau for creating interactive data visualizations and Shorthand for presenting the findings in an engaging, narrative-driven format.

Tableau will be used to design and develop interactive visualizations. These visualizations will help showcase trends in depression rates across demographics. Tableau's interactivity will allow users to explore the data themselves.

Shorthand will serve as the platform for integrating the Tableau visualizations into a cohesive digital narrative. It will enable the inclusion of textual explanations, annotated visualizations, and a logical flow to guide the audience through the project's findings. This platform ensures the project is accessible, visually appealing, and engaging for my target audience, including policymakers, mental health advocates, and researchers.

The final deliverable will be an interactive, stand-alone web-based story hosted online. It will combine data visualizations created in Tableau with a storytelling format built in Shorthand. The project will include explanations and insights that provide actionable recommendations based on the data. This approach ensures the project is both visually impactful and easy to navigate, offering an immersive experience for the audience.
