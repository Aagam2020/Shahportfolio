# Final Project: Adult Depression Analysis (2012â€“2018)

## High-Level Summary

This project analyzes trends in adult depression from 2012 to 2018, focusing on demographic factors such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex. The aim is to uncover disparities in depression rates across different population groups and identify patterns that can inform interventions and policy decisions.

By exploring data segmented by these demographic factors, the project seeks to answer critical questions, such as: Which age groups and income levels report the highest rates of depression? Are there significant differences in depression rates between racial or ethnic groups? How do education and sex influence depression prevalence? Through data visualization and storytelling, this project will present a clear narrative to policymakers, mental health professionals, and advocates. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to improve mental health resources and reduce disparities in care.

## Project Structure

### **Introduction (Setting the Stage)**

The introduction will provide an overview of adult depression as a growing public health issue from 2012 to 2018. It will highlight the societal and economic impacts of untreated depression and present the dataset, emphasizing its coverage of demographics such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex. The section will set the stage for the analysis, showing why understanding these disparities is critical. The introduction will conclude with a one-sentence summary: *"Understanding how depression affects different demographics over time can guide targeted interventions and improve mental health outcomes."*

### **Rising Insights (Exploring the Data)**

This section will analyze trends in depression rates over the years 2012 to 2018. It will explore key demographic breakdowns, including age groups, income levels, education levels, race-ethnicities, and sex. The analysis will focus on identifying which age groups experience the highest and lowest rates of depression, how economic disparities correlate with depression prevalence, and how education and sex influence depression rates. Visualizations will include line charts for depression rates over time by age group, bar charts for depression prevalence by income or education, and heatmaps to show regional differences in depression across race-ethnicities.

### **Climactic Reveal (Key Findings)**

The climactic reveal will present the most impactful insights, such as identifying the demographic groups most affected by depression. It will highlight disparities and discuss possible causes, including economic inequities and access to mental health services. The findings may include trends like *"Depression rates were highest among individuals with low income and those identifying as [specific racial-ethnic group]."* This section will also uncover unexpected trends, such as improvements or worsening disparities over time, and provide data-driven insights to emphasize key discoveries.

### **Resolution (Actionable Takeaways)**

The resolution will summarize the key takeaways, including which demographics require targeted mental health resources and policy recommendations to address the identified disparities. It will conclude with a call to action for policymakers to invest in mental health programs targeting the most affected groups and for mental health professionals to develop tailored interventions for high-risk populations. The section will close by emphasizing the importance of addressing these disparities to improve mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of depression.
