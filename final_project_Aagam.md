# Final Project: Adult Depression Analysis (2012â€“2018)

## High-Level Summary

This project analyzes trends in adult depression from 2012 to 2018, focusing on demographic factors such as age, income, education, race-ethnicities, and sex. The aim is to uncover disparities in depression rates across different population groups and identify patterns that can inform interventions and policy decisions.

By exploring data segmented by these demographic factors, the project seeks to answer critical questions, such as:
- Which age groups and income levels report the highest rates of depression?
- Are there significant differences in depression rates between racial or ethnic groups?
- How do education and sex influence depression prevalence?

Through data visualization and storytelling, this project will present a clear narrative to policymakers, mental health professionals, and advocates. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to improve mental health resources and reduce disparities in care.
