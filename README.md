# TSWD-portfolio-templates
Portfolio templates for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages as you like for your own portfolio!  
Sometimes it's helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference: 

- Web page URL: https://cmustudent.github.io/tswd-portfolio-templates/
- This repository: https://github.com/cmustudent/tswd-portfolio-templates/

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I really like data.  And I like visualizations.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. List item #1
2. List item #2
3. List item #3

or...

- List item #1
- List item #2
- List item #3

# Portfolio

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).

# Shahportfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About Me
Hello! My name is Aagam Shah, and I use he/him pronouns. I'm currently an international student in the United States, pursuing my studies with a strong focus on product management. With a background in both technology and client-facing roles, I’ve enjoyed working on projects that blend technical skills with user-centered design. One of my key ongoing projects, for example, is a movie recommendation service that leverages machine learning and real-time data to deliver personalized recommendations. This project has allowed me to deepen my experience with streaming data systems like Kafka and hands-on deployment of models using Flask, which has been both challenging and rewarding.

Beyond academics, I’m passionate about sports and understanding human psychology. I find joy in taking on ambitious projects and always aim to connect my technical work to meaningful outcomes. In my free time, I enjoy staying active by going to the gym regularly and am working towards a personal goal. Looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and contributing to innovative and impactful projects!

# What I hope to learn
In this course, Telling Stories with Data, I'm excited to dive into the art of data visualization and develop a skill set that combines narrative techniques with technical expertise in data storytelling. With data becoming a cornerstone of policy-making and strategic decisions, I look forward to honing my ability to convey complex information in an engaging and insightful way. I’m particularly interested in exploring how data visualization can be tailored for different audiences, using design elements that not only inform but also resonate with viewers. This aligns closely with my career goals, as I aim to apply these skills in product management, leveraging data to drive better decision-making and ultimately create a positive user experience.
