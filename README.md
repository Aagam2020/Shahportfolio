# About Me
Hello! My name is Aagam Shah, and I use he/him pronouns. I'm currently an international student in the United States, pursuing my studies with a strong focus on product management. With a background in both technology and client-facing roles, I’ve enjoyed working on projects that blend technical skills with user-centered design. One of my key ongoing projects, for example, is a movie recommendation service that leverages machine learning and real-time data to deliver personalized recommendations. This project has allowed me to deepen my experience with streaming data systems like Kafka and hands-on deployment of models using Flask, which has been both challenging and rewarding.

Beyond academics, I’m passionate about sports and understanding human psychology. I find joy in taking on ambitious projects and always aim to connect my technical work to meaningful outcomes. In my free time, I enjoy staying active by going to the gym regularly and am working towards a personal goal. Looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and contributing to innovative and impactful projects!

# What I hope to learn
In this course, Telling Stories with Data, I'm excited to dive into the art of data visualization and develop a skill set that combines narrative techniques with technical expertise in data storytelling. With data becoming a cornerstone of policy-making and strategic decisions, I look forward to honing my ability to convey complex information in an engaging and insightful way. I’m particularly interested in exploring how data visualization can be tailored for different audiences, using design elements that not only inform but also resonate with viewers. This aligns closely with my career goals, as I aim to apply these skills in product management, leveraging data to drive better decision-making and ultimately create a positive user experience.
