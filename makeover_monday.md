# Makeover Monday: AI Image Generation Trends

**Original Visualization:**  
[Google Trends Data on AI Image Generators](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-01-01%202024-02-16&geo=US&q=Midjourney,Stable%20Diffusion,DALL%20E&hl=eng)

**Description and Reason for Selection:**  
I chose this data visualization from Google Trends because it highlights the growing popularity and interest in AI image generation tools such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E over the past two years. These tools have significantly impacted the fields of digital art, content creation, and AI-driven media, capturing both public and professional attention.

This visualization is particularly relevant as it allows us to see the comparative interest in these tools over time, showcasing trends in user engagement and public curiosity. The information is useful for understanding which platforms are gaining traction and could potentially inform decisions in fields ranging from marketing to AI research. The visualization is publicly accessible, making it a great choice for a deeper analysis and redesign as part of the Makeover Monday project.

## Feedback Summary from Visualization Interviews

### Participant Feedback

**Student, mid 20’s**

  **Question 1**: "The chart shows the popularity of different AI tools over time based on search interest."
  
  **Question 2**: "I can see which line represents which tool from the legend, but the colors are faint in this sketch."
  
  **Question 3**: "The labeled points like P1, P2, and P3 seem to mark important events, but the labels could be more detailed to explain why those events are significant."
  
  **Question 4**: "The 'Peak Popularity' line at the top indicates the maximum interest level, and it does help show which lines are closest to peak popularity."
  
  **Question 5**: "I understand the average chart in the bottom left corner shows the average popularity of each tool over the time period."
  
  **Question 6**: "The legend could be clearer, maybe with stronger colors. The annotation labels could also explain the events a bit more."

**Student, mid 20’s**

  **Question 1**: "It seems to track the rise and fall of interest for each tool, highlighting some key events."
  
  **Question 2**: "It’s mostly clear, though maybe adding stronger colors or line patterns could make it even clearer."
  
  **Question 3**: "The labeled points are helpful, especially with explanations like 'DALL-E Launch' and 'Midjourney free release,' but more details would be useful."
  
  **Question 4**: "The 'Peak Popularity' line is helpful, though it might be good to mention that it represents 100 as the highest relative interest."
  
  **Question 5**: "The average chart in the bottom left corner is clear and shows overall popularity, which is helpful."
  
  **Question 6**: "I’d suggest moving the average values to a more central location, maybe at the top, and using slightly thicker lines."

### Key Takeaways and Patterns

From the feedback, several patterns and suggestions emerged:
1. **Legend and Colors**: Both participants noted that clearer colors or stronger line patterns would improve the legend and line identification.
2. **Event Annotations**: There is a desire for slightly more detailed annotations, explaining the significance of events.
3. **Average Section Placement**: Participants suggested placing the average section closer to the lines or at the top of the chart for better visibility.
4. **Peak Popularity Line**: Both participants understood its purpose but recommended adding a note clarifying that it represents the maximum interest (100).

### Design Changes Based on Feedback

1. **Enhance Legend and Line Colors**: Use stronger colors or line patterns to make the legend and lines more distinguishable.
2. **Detailed Annotations**: Add short descriptions to event markers (e.g., "Midjourney free release") to provide more context.
3. **Move Average Section**: Relocate the average values to a more prominent position, possibly above the main chart.
4. **Clarify Peak Popularity Line**: Add a small label or note to explain that this line represents the relative peak interest value (100).

These changes aim to improve the chart's clarity, context, and usability based on user feedback.

# Summary

## Description and Reason for Selection
I chose to analyze and redesign a data visualization from Google Trends that tracks the popularity of AI image generation tools—Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E—over the past two years. This visualization is relevant for understanding trends in digital art and AI, highlighting which tools have gained the most public attention over time. It could inform strategic decisions for professionals in marketing, AI research, and content creation. Since this information is publicly accessible, it is an ideal choice for a Makeover Monday project.

## Initial Critique and Redesign Considerations
When critiquing the original visualization, I identified several areas for improvement. First, the legend clarity and line colors were somewhat faint, making it hard to distinguish between tools. Additionally, the chart included labeled points marking events like tool launches, but the significance of these points wasn’t clear. Another element, the peak popularity line, indicated the maximum popularity at 100 but lacked a label to explain its meaning. Finally, there was an additional average popularity chart, but it was positioned in a less prominent area. These observations informed my initial redesign goals: to enhance clarity, add context to event markers, improve color contrast, and make the average values and peak line more informative.

## Sketching the Solution
I created a sketch of an improved version of the visualization, focusing on stronger colors for the lines and a more detailed legend. I also decided to add brief explanations for key events and reposition the average values to be more prominent. This sketch served as a blueprint for the feedback collection phase.

## Feedback Collection and Insights
I interviewed two participants (both students in their mid-20s) to gather feedback on the redesigned sketch.

Both participants felt that stronger colors would make the lines and legend easier to identify. One suggested using line patterns as an alternative. They appreciated the labeled points marking key events but wanted a bit more explanation about the significance of these events. The participants understood the peak line's purpose but felt that a clearer label (such as “Peak Popularity” at the top) would add clarity. Finally, they found the average section helpful but recommended moving it to a more central or prominent location, possibly at the top of the chart.

## Key Takeaways from Feedback
The feedback highlighted several design patterns and priorities. It was recommended to use stronger, more contrasting colors or line patterns for easier identification. Adding more context to the event annotations would help explain each event’s significance. Placing the average values in a more visible area would improve accessibility, and labeling the peak popularity line explicitly would clarify that it represents the maximum interest level.

## Design Changes Based on Feedback
Based on the feedback, I implemented the following changes. I chose more vivid colors (purple for DALL-E, green for MidJourney, red for Stable Diffusion) and made the lines slightly thicker to improve visibility. Short descriptions were added to each event marker, such as “DALL-E Launch” and “MidJourney no longer free,” to provide context at key points. I moved the average values (8 for MidJourney, 5 for Stable Diffusion, and 5 for DALL-E) to the top of the chart, creating a small legend that shows the average popularity for each tool. Finally, I labeled the 100 line at the top as "Peak Popularity" to clarify its role as the maximum interest level.

## Final Redesign and Rationale
The redesigned visualization now provides a clear, comparative view of the popularity trends for each tool, with easy-to-read labels, event annotations, and a prominent legend showing average values. I selected a line chart to emphasize the temporal trend and overlaid a peak popularity line to highlight points of maximum interest. These changes aim to make the visualization more accessible and informative, providing viewers with a quick, intuitive understanding of which tools have dominated public interest over time.
