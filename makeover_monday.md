# Makeover Monday: AI Image Generation Trends

**Original Visualization:**  
[Google Trends Data on AI Image Generators](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-01-01%202024-02-16&geo=US&q=Midjourney,Stable%20Diffusion,DALL%20E&hl=eng)

**Description and Reason for Selection:**  
I chose this data visualization from Google Trends because it highlights the growing popularity and interest in AI image generation tools such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E over the past two years. These tools have significantly impacted the fields of digital art, content creation, and AI-driven media, capturing both public and professional attention.

This visualization is particularly relevant as it allows us to see the comparative interest in these tools over time, showcasing trends in user engagement and public curiosity. The information is useful for understanding which platforms are gaining traction and could potentially inform decisions in fields ranging from marketing to AI research. The visualization is publicly accessible, making it a great choice for a deeper analysis and redesign as part of the Makeover Monday project.

**P.S. I am only working on the first data viz after clicking on the link which redirects you to the Google Trends page.**
## List of Questions Asked

1. **"What do you think this chart is showing? Can you summarize it in your own words?"**

2. **"Can you tell me what each of the lines represents? Is it clear which AI tool each line corresponds to?"**

3. **"What do you think the labeled points like 'P1,' 'P2,' and 'P3' mean? Do these annotations help you understand the chart better?"**

4. **"Do you understand what the 'Peak Popularity' line at the top signifies? Does it add clarity to the data?"**

5. **"Do you understand what the average chart in the bottom left corner means?"**

6. **"Is there anything about this chart that you find confusing or would change to make it easier to understand?"**

## Feedback Summary from Visualization Interviews

### Participant Feedback

- **Student, mid 20’s**
  - **Question 1**: "The chart shows the popularity of different AI tools over time based on search interest."
  - **Question 2**: "I can see which line represents which tool from the legend, but the colors are faint in this sketch."
  - **Question 3**: "The labeled points like P1, P2, and P3 seem to mark important events, but the labels could be more detailed to explain why those events are significant."
  - **Question 4**: "The 'Peak Popularity' line at the top indicates the maximum interest level, and it does help show which lines are closest to peak popularity."
  - **Question 5**: "I understand the average chart in the bottom left corner shows the average popularity of each tool over the time period."
  - **Question 6**: "The legend could be clearer, maybe with stronger colors. The annotation labels could also explain the events a bit more."

- **Student, mid 20’s**
  - **Question 1**: "It seems to track the rise and fall of interest for each tool, highlighting some key events."
  - **Question 2**: "It’s mostly clear, though maybe adding stronger colors or line patterns could make it even clearer."
  - **Question 3**: "The labeled points are helpful, especially with explanations like 'DALL-E Launch' and 'Midjourney free release,' but more details would be useful."
  - **Question 4**: "The 'Peak Popularity' line is helpful, though it might be good to mention that it represents 100 as the highest relative interest."
  - **Question 5**: "The average chart in the bottom left corner is clear and shows overall popularity, which is helpful."
  - **Question 6**: "I’d suggest moving the average values to a more central location, maybe at the top, and using slightly thicker lines."

### Key Takeaways and Patterns

From the feedback, several patterns and suggestions emerged:
1. **Legend and Colors**: Both participants noted that clearer colors or stronger line patterns would improve the legend and line identification.
2. **Event Annotations**: There is a desire for slightly more detailed annotations, explaining the significance of events.
3. **Average Section Placement**: Participants suggested placing the average section closer to the lines or at the top of the chart for better visibility.
4. **Peak Popularity Line**: Both participants understood its purpose but recommended adding a note clarifying that it represents the maximum interest (100).

### Design Changes Based on Feedback

1. **Enhance Legend and Line Colors**: Use stronger colors or line patterns to make the legend and lines more distinguishable.
2. **Detailed Annotations**: Add short descriptions to event markers (e.g., "Midjourney free release") to provide more context.
3. **Move Average Section**: Relocate the average values to a more prominent position, possibly above the main chart.
4. **Clarify Peak Popularity Line**: Add a small label or note to explain that this line represents the relative peak interest value (100).

These changes aim to improve the chart's clarity, context, and usability based on user feedback.
